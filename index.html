<!--The HTML validator throws a warning here because I do not have any headings contained directly in this article. I took the heading out of the first section, out it in the article, and reformatted everything to make it look the same, but then the validator got mad at me because I now had a <section> without a heading. I understand why it is throwing this warning, but I think it may be worth ignoring in this case. That said, would it be better for me to just remove the article container altogether? Or to not worry about the section containers and just have 3 seperate article containers in my main container? Are all three acceptable solutions???-->

            <h2>About "Me"</h2>
            <p>I grew up in Waterford, MI and lived in that part of the country until I was 23. In 2018, I moved to                 Durango, CO to pursue a short-lived career as a professional mountain biker. Then, in 2021, I moved                  to New York city, where I currently reside.</p>
            <p>With much excitement and anticipation, I started my Thinkful journey in February of 2022. I have                     always been a bit resistant to the idea of pursuing this particular career as both my dad and my                     grandfather are computer programmers and I felt compelled to forge my own path, despite all the signs                 telling me this would be a good idea.</p>
            <p>It feels great to have finally accepted the fact that this was probably my destiny all along. I am                   eagerly looking forward to diving head-first into the world of web development!</p>
