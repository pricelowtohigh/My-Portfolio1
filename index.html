            <h2>About "Me"</h2>
            <p>I grew up in Waterford, MI and lived in that part of the country until I was 23. In 2018, I moved to                 Durango, CO to pursue a short-lived career as a professional mountain biker. Then, in 2021, I moved                  to New York city, where I currently reside.</p>
            <p>With much excitement and anticipation, I started my Thinkful journey in February of 2022. I have                     always been a bit resistant to the idea of pursuing this particular career as both my dad and my                     grandfather are computer programmers and I felt compelled to forge my own path, despite all the signs                 telling me this would be a good idea.</p>
            <p>It feels great to have finally accepted the fact that this was probably my destiny all along. I am                   eagerly looking forward to diving head-first into the world of web development!</p>
